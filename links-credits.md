## Credits - Building on the shoulders of giants!
I would be remiss if I didn't attempt to give credit where due. We constantly build on the hard work and efforts of others, and hopefully, we can give back even more in return. No one becomes successful without hard work, luck, and lots of help along the way. 

In that light, my heartfelt thanks to each and everyone in the references section below. I tried my best to record all of the sites and sources that I may have pillage along my voyage.  Apologies to anyone inadvertently missed.
